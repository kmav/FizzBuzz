### What is this repository for? ###

* Quick summary
You may find in this repository my experimentations according to Yvette excellent multipart course in TDD: [Getting Started with TDD in Swift 3](https://medium.com/@ynzc/getting-started-with-tdd-in-swift-2fab3e07204b#.2i3j6w7o1)
The initial example is expanded to include the option to restart the game. 

* TDD summary
Test Driven Development (or TDD to its friends) is a way of writing software. At its core is a simple cycle with 3 stages:
*RED* — Write a test, and watch it fail.
*GREEN* — Write just enough code to make your test pass.
*REFACTOR* — Clean up existing code. - refactor (tidy up) the code.
*Repeat the TDD cycle* until you have an app!

It sounds deceptively simple, but it’s a powerful way to write your code. In other wordsm we can formulate 3 laws:

*First Law* You may not write production code until you have written a failing unit test. 
*Second Law* You may not write more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail, and not com-
piling is failing.
*Third Law* You may not write more production code than is sufficient to pass the cur- rently failing test.

Following these laws perfectly doesn’t always make sense. Sometimes you’ll write a larger test. Sometimes you’ll write extra production code. Sometimes you’ll write tests after you’ve written the code to make them pass. Sometimes it’ll take more than two minutes to go around the loop. The goal isn’t perfect adherence to the laws—it’s to decrease the interval between writing tests and production code to a matter of minutes.
